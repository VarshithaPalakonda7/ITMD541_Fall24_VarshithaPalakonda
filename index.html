            <p>I’m originally from Hyderabad, a city in India known for its rich history and vibrant culture. It’s especially famous for its delicious dish, Hyderabad Dum Biryani.</p></br>
            <p>I have a total of three years of experience in web development. I spent two years as a Frontend Web Developer at Infosys, where I worked on client projects using Angular, JavaScript, TypeScript, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, and OutSystems11. Additionally, I have one year of experience as a student, during which I developed various projects using React.js and Angular.

              Most recently, in association with Illinois Tech Career Services, I collaborated with a group of six to develop the ‘PlanItNow’ application using React.js.</p></br>
            <p>I’m currently in my first year of the Master’s program in Information Technology and Management at the Illinois Institute of Technology.</p>
